    <p style="color:rgb(219, 10, 10) ;"> In the time of my confession in the hour of my deepest need 
      when the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
    Theres a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere
  Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair

   Dont have the inclination to look back on any mistake
  Like cain, I nowbehold this chain of events that I must break
  In the fury of the moment I can see the masters hand
In every leaf that trembles, and in every grain of sand

Oh, the flower of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
I gaze into the doorway of temptations angry flame And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand

I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summers dream, in the chill of a wintry light 
In the bitter dance of loneliness, fading into space 
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face

I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, theres someone there, other time its only me 
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan
Lkie every sparrow failling, like every grain of sand.</p>
